    <p>We are currently seeking developers and community members interested in participating in the future of annotation.</p>
    <p>Our intended focus areas are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>a collaborative community for creating annotation related code</li>
      <li>a future for Annotator.js-based projects and plugins</li>
      <li>enabling Web Annotation in Web browsers, Web Publication readers, and the servers that serve them</li>
    </ul>

    <h5 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h5>
    <p><em>Apache Annotator is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) sponsored by the Apache Incubator PMC. Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.</em></p>
